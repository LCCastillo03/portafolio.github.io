            <p>
                Since I began studying Computer Science, the area that has attracted me the most is development, specifically FrontEnd. A few years ago, 
                I completed a technical course in graphic design, and I believe I have a special talent for visualizing colors, aesthetics, and typography, which is fundamental for web design.
                In the near future, I would like to dedicate myself entirely to this field, as it is an area that never stops evolving and always offers new learning opportunities. Additionally, 
                FrontEnd development has a wide range of job opportunities.

                the book forces you to think, to smile, to cry, to get angry at injustice and applaud the revenge of the just. 
                The book is food, shelter, a seat, clothing that wraps me, a mouth that kisses my mouth. A place that contains the universe."
